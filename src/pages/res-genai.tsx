              <p className="text-light">
                Generative AI refers to a branch of artificial intelligence that
                focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, audio, or
                videos, by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike
                traditional AI systems, which are designed primarily to analyze
                or classify data, generative AI models, such as GPT (text),
                DALLÂ·E (images), and others, generate outputs that mimic human
                creativity. These systems use techniques like deep learning and
                neural networks to predict and produce content that aligns with
                user prompts or input data.
